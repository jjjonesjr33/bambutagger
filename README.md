```

> The menu scrolls — up to 4 items are visible at a time; rotate the encoder past the last visible row to reveal more.

### 1 · Read Tag
Hold a spool near the RC522.  The sketch derives MIFARE keys from the tag UID using HKDF-SHA256, authenticates all 16 sectors, and displays filament type, colour, and weight.  The WS2812B LED lights up in the actual filament colour.

### 2 · Clone Tag
Reads the source tag sector-by-sector into RAM, then prompts for the destination tag.  Writes every block to the target tag.

**Key handling during clone/write:**

The write routine first attempts to unlock the card via the **Gen1A hardware backdoor** (send `0x40` / `0x43` — a special command accepted only by "magic" MIFARE clone chips).  If the card responds, all 64 blocks are written directly with **no sector authentication required**, including block 0 (normally read-only UID block).  This transparently handles Chinese Gen1A clone cards that were previously written with unknown Bambu keys.

If Gen1A is not detected, the routine probes for **Gen4 (GTU / GDM / USCUID)** cards by sending the version command `CF 00000000 CC` — a genuine Gen4 card responds `00 00 00 02 AA`. If confirmed, all 64 blocks (including block 0 / UID) are written verbatim via `CF <pw> CD` backdoor commands.

If Gen4 is not detected, the routine tries **Gen3 (APDU-based)** cards by sending `90 F0 CC CC 10 <block0>`. A Gen3 card responds `90 00` — this both detects the card type and writes block 0 (UID) atomically. Blocks 1–63 are then written via 3-key normal auth, with trailer keys derived from the dump's UID (which the card now presents).

If Gen3 also fails, the routine enters the **normal-auth path** — which transparently handles **Gen2 / CUID / FUID** cards. These look like standard MIFARE but allow writing block 0 after normal auth. The routine detects this implicitly by attempting `MIFARE_Write` to block 0; on Gen2 it succeeds (UID overwritten), on genuine MIFARE it fails silently. Once block 0 is confirmed written and sector 0's trailer is complete, the reader **cycles the RF antenna** (`PCD_AntennaOff` → 30 ms → `PCD_AntennaOn` → re-poll) so the card power-cycles from HALT state back to IDLE and responds to the next REQA. A plain `PICC_HaltA()` is insufficient here: ISO 14443A halted cards ignore REQA (0x26) and only wake on WUPA (0x52), but the MFRC522 library's `PICC_IsNewCardPresent()` sends REQA — so the card would silently ignore every re-poll attempt. The antenna cycle forces a hard capacitor drain, returning the card to IDLE state where it answers REQA normally. The MFRC522 then re-discovers the card's UID (new dump UID) and sectors 1–15 auth proceeds correctly.

If none of the above magic paths are detected (genuine MIFARE Classic), the routine falls back to a **3-key normal-auth strategy**:

| Path | Condition | How it works |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Gen1A backdoor** | Card responds to `0x40` / `0x43` | All 64 blocks written verbatim; block 0 (UID) overwritten |
| **Gen4 (GTU/GDM)** | Card responds to `CF 00000000 CC` with version `00 00 00 02 AA` | All 64 blocks written verbatim via `CF <pw> CD` commands; block 0 (UID) overwritten |
| **Gen3 (APDU)** | Card responds `90 00` to APDU `90 F0 CC CC 10 <block0>` | Block 0 written via APDU; blocks 1–63 via 3-key auth; trailers use dump-UID-derived keys |
| **Gen2 implicit** | Standard MIFARE protocol; block 0 write succeeds after normal auth | Detected during sector 0 write; block 0 overwritten; RF antenna cycled off/on so card exits HALT → IDLE state and responds to REQA; trailer keys re-derived from dump UID; sectors 1–15 auth then succeeds |
| **Normal auth** | Genuine MIFARE Classic (block 0 read-only) | 3-key trial per sector; trailers re-written with dest-UID-derived keys |

Normal-auth key trial order:

| Priority | Key tried | Succeeds when target is… |
|----------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| 1 | `FFFFFFFFFFFF` | blank / factory-fresh tag |
| 2 | Bambu key derived from **dest UID** | previously used Bambu spool |
| 3 | Bambu key derived from **source UID** | (fallback; rarely needed) |

On the normal-auth path, sector trailers are always written with dest-UID-derived keys so the Bambu printer can authenticate the result correctly.

The write function returns the number of sectors written successfully (0–16).  The OLED and LED show three outcomes:

| Result | LED | Message |
|--------|-----|---------|
| 16/16 sectors OK | 🟢 green flash | "Write complete!" |
| 1–15/16 sectors OK | 🟠 amber flash | "Partial! X/16 sec" |
| 0/16 sectors | 🔴 red flash | "Write failed!" |

### 3 · Write Dump
Browse the dump files stored on FAT using the on-device directory browser.  The browser reflects the real folder tree on the FAT partition (mirroring the GitHub repo structure).  Select a `.bin` file, present a target tag, and every block is written using the same Gen1A-backdoor / 3-key auth strategy described above.  Gen1A, Gen4 (GTU/GDM/USCUID), Gen3 (APDU), and Gen2 (CUID/FUID) magic cards are all detected automatically — no special configuration is needed.

#### FAT directory browser

Row 0 of the list is always a navigation shortcut:

| Depth | Row 0 label | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Root | `<< MENU` | Return to main menu |
| Inside a subfolder | `< BACK` | Go up one level |

| Encoder action | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Rotate | Move cursor up / down (wraps: past last entry → entry 1; past entry 1 → last entry) |
| Click `<< MENU` (root) | Return to main menu |
| Click `< BACK` (sub-dir) | Go up one level |
| Click on `> DIRNAME` | Enter that subdirectory |
| Click on a `.bin` file | Load dump → show write-confirm screen |

- **Title bar** shows the current directory name (e.g. `PLA_BASIC`, `BLACK`); root shows `Select Dump`.
- Entries are sorted: subdirectories first (prefix `>`), then `.bin` files.
- Up to 4 rows are visible at a time; the list scrolls with the cursor.
- After a GitHub download completes, the OLED shows a write-confirm screen so you can write the tag immediately (see **§ 4 · GitHub Lib**). The FAT browser is also pre-navigated to the downloaded file's folder so you can write it later from **3 · Write Dump**.

### 4 · GitHub Lib
Browse the [Bambu Lab RFID Library](https://github.com/queengooborg/Bambu-Lab-RFID-Library) repository **directly on the OLED** — no PC required.  Requires WiFi (STA) connectivity.

Every level has a direct `<< MENU` shortcut.  At the root, row 0 is `<< MENU`.  Inside any subdirectory, row 0 is `< BACK` (go up one level) and row 1 is `<< MENU` (return to main menu).

```
[root]
  Row 0: << MENU
  └─ PLA/
        Row 0: < BACK
        Row 1: << MENU
        └─ PLA Basic/
              Row 0: < BACK
              Row 1: << MENU
              └─ Black/
                    Row 0: < BACK
                    Row 1: << MENU
                    └─ 3AD82DAD/
                          Row 0: < BACK
                          Row 1: << MENU
                          └─ dump.json  ← click to download
```

| Encoder action | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Rotate | Move cursor up / down |
| Click `<< MENU` (root) | Return to main menu |
| Click `< BACK` (sub-level row 0) | Go up one directory level |
| Click `<< MENU` (sub-level row 1) | Return to main menu directly |
| Click on folder | Navigate into it |
| Click on file | Download → save to FAT → write-confirm screen |

Files are saved to FAT mirroring the GitHub repository directory structure:

| Repo path | Saved as |
|-----------|----------|
| `PLA/PLA Basic/Black/3AD82DAD/dump.bin` | `/PLA/PLA_BASIC/BLACK/3AD82DAD.bin` |
| `ABS/ABS Basic/Red/F1A2B3C4/dump.json` | `/ABS/ABS_BASIC/RED/F1A2B3C4.bin` |
| `TPU/TPU 95A HF/White/00112233/dump.bin` | `/TPU/TPU_95A_HF/WHITE/00112233.bin` |

Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.

#### Write-confirm after download

After a successful download the OLED immediately shows a write-confirm screen (identical to the BambuMan flow):

```
GitHub OK!
PLA Basic
PLA Matte

[click]=WRITE
[enc]=cancel
```

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Click** (within 15 s) | Load dump → enter RFID write flow immediately |
| **Rotate encoder** | Cancel — return to GitHub browser at same directory |
| **15 s timeout** | Same as rotate — return to browser |

The dump is also pre-loaded into the write buffer, so if you cancel and later navigate to **3 · Write Dump** the cursor is already positioned on the file.

> **Tip:** Set a GitHub personal access token in the **WiFi tab** of the web UI to raise the API rate limit from 60 to 5 000 requests/hour.

### 5 · BambuMan Lib
Browse the [bambuman.ee](https://bambuman.ee/tags) community tag database **directly on the OLED** in a 4-level hierarchy.  Requires WiFi.  The catalog can be synced from the OLED itself — no PC or web browser needed.

#### Catalog hierarchy

Every level has a direct `<< MENU` shortcut at the top.

At the **Material level** (top), two fixed rows appear before any material entries:

```
<< MENU            ← return to main menu
> Sync Catalog     ← sync the catalog without leaving the OLED
PLA
PETG
ABS
TPU
…
```

At **Type / Color / UID levels**, two fixed rows appear before entries:

```
< BACK             ← go up one level
<< MENU            ← return to main menu directly
PLA_BASIC
PLA_MATTE
…
```

Drill down to reach individual UIDs:

```
Material (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU …)
  └─ Type (PLA_BASIC, PLA_MATTE …)
        └─ Color (BLACK, RED, MARBLE …)
              └─ UID (3AD82DAD, 9510C2A3 …)  ← click to fetch & write
```

#### Encoder controls

| Encoder action | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Rotate | Move cursor up / down |
| Click `<< MENU` (any level) | Return to main menu |
| Click `> Sync Catalog` (Material level, row 1) | Run catalog sync on-device (see below) |
| Click `< BACK` (Type / Color / UID level, row 0) | Go up one level |
| Click a Material / Type / Color | Navigate into it |
| Click a UID | Fetch `data.bin` from bambuman.ee → save to `/{MAT}/{TYPE}/{COLOR}/{UID}.bin` |
| Click after a successful fetch | Enter RFID write flow immediately |
| Rotate after a successful fetch | Cancel fetch result, stay in browser |

#### OLED Sync Catalog flow

Clicking **> Sync Catalog** runs a 4-step progress sequence directly on the OLED:

| Step | Display | What happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `1/4 Find ZIP…` | Probes `bambuman.ee/files/data_YYYY-MM-DD.zip` for the last 7 days |
| 2 | `2/4 Getting size…` | HTTP HEAD request to determine ZIP length |
| 3 | `3/4 Read EOCD…` | Fetches the last 512 bytes to locate the central directory |
| 4 | `4/4 Writing…` (counter) | Streams the central directory only (~400 KB Range request), writes `/BM/catalog.json` |

On success the OLED shows **"Done! N entries"** and the LED flashes green — click the encoder to return to the material browser.  On any error a red message is shown for 3 seconds before returning to the browser.

> **No decompression** — only the ZIP file listing is fetched, not the full archive.  The Range request is typically 400–500 KB regardless of how many dump files are in the ZIP.

#### Navigation cache

To eliminate per-keypress SD reads at the top three levels, BambuTagger pre-loads the entire Material / Type / Color index into RAM the first time you enter the BambuMan browser:

| Cache level | Contents | Max slots |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| L0 | Distinct materials | 24 |
| L1 | Distinct mat + type combos | 96 |
| L2 | Distinct mat + type + color combos | 128 |

**Total RAM footprint:** ~19 KB (statically allocated).

- **Built lazily** — single-pass read of `/BM/catalog.json` on first open; takes 1–3 s. Debug output: `[BM] Cache built: L0=8  L1=22  L2=97`
- **Level 3 (UIDs)** — still streamed from the catalog file; all higher levels are served from RAM.
- **Auto-invalidated** after every catalog sync (OLED **> Sync Catalog** or web UI **🔄 Sync Catalog**) — the updated catalog is reflected on next browse entry.

#### Error states

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `No catalog — sync first` | `/BM/catalog.json` is missing — use `> Sync Catalog` (row 1) or the web UI BambuMan tab |
| `UID not found` | HTTP 404 from bambuman.ee |
| `Blocked (CF) — try Web UI` | HTTP 403 (Cloudflare) — use the web UI BambuMan tab instead |

### 6 · Gen4 Tool

A dedicated flow for managing the GTU backdoor on **Gen4 (GTU / GDM / USCUID)** magic cards — **without** needing to write a dump first.

#### How to use

1. Select **8 Gen4 Tool** from the main menu.
2. When prompted, place the card on the reader (20 s window, teal LED pulse).
3. The sketch probes the card via `CF 00000000 CC`:
   - **Not a Gen4 card** → shows a message and returns to the menu.
   - **Gen4 confirmed** → reads the current GTU mode byte and displays it in the header.
4. An action menu appears:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Gen4  magic on(0x03)│
│> Skip                │
│  Seal                │
│  Unlock              │
└──────────────────────┘
```

| Option | GTU cfg[0] value | Effect |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Skip** (default) | unchanged | No config change; return to menu |
| **Seal** | `0x00` | Magic backdoor permanently **off**; card is indistinguishable from a genuine MIFARE Classic |
| **Unlock** | `0x03` | Magic backdoor **on**; all CF backdoor commands accepted again |

> ⚠️ **Sealing is irreversible via software.** A sealed card (`0x00`) disables its own backdoor, so `gen4Unlock()` will fail on a sealed card. Physical re-flashing of the chip is the only recovery path.

#### Post-write seal/unlock prompt

The same 3-option mini-menu also appears automatically after a **successful Gen4 write** (all 16 sectors OK) in the Write Dump flow, giving you the option to seal or unlock the card immediately after programming.

| Encoder action | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Click on chosen option | Execute Seal / Unlock / Skip |
| 20 s timeout | Auto-Skip |

#### LED colours during Gen4 Tool

| State | LED |
|-------|-----|
| Waiting for card | 🩵 Teal pulse |
| Seal success | 🟢 2 × green flash |
| Seal failure | 🔴 2 × red flash |
| Unlock success | 🟢 2 × green flash |
| Unlock failure | 🔴 2 × red flash |
| Not a Gen4 card | 🟠 2 × amber flash |

- **✍️ Write** any `.bin` file directly to an RFID tag: click the button, place a tag on the RC522 within 20 seconds.  A modal overlay shows progress and polls for completion.
- **Delete** any `.bin` file with the 🗑 button (full path passed to the server).

### Tab 2 — GitHub Library
- Browse the GitHub repository tree by folder path.
- Click any `.bin` or `.json` dump file to download it directly to FAT.
- Downloaded files are stored in a directory tree matching the GitHub repo structure (e.g. `/PLA/PLA_BASIC/BLACK/3AD82DAD.bin`).

### Tab 3 — BambuMan Library
Browse and search the [bambuman.ee](https://bambuman.ee/tags) community tag database without leaving the web UI.

#### Sync Catalog
Click **🔄 Sync Catalog** to fetch the bambuman.ee file index.  The ESP32 sends an HTTP Range request for the ZIP **central directory only** (~400 KB, no decompression), parses all `Material/Type/Color/UID/data.bin` paths, and saves them to `/BM/catalog.json` on FAT.

- Takes ~30–60 seconds on first run.
- The entry count is shown after a successful sync (e.g. "2 622 entries — ready to search").
- Re-sync any time to pick up new community dumps.
- The same sync can also be triggered from the OLED (**5 BambuMan Lib → > Sync Catalog**) without opening a browser.

#### Search
- **Material dropdown** — auto-populated from the catalog (PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU …).
- **Color / name text input** — live-filters the results as you type.
- Scrollable results table (up to 100 rows): UID · Material · Type · Color.
- Per-row **⬇ Fetch** — downloads `data.bin` to `/{MAT}/{TYPE}/{COLOR}/{UID}.bin` (material/type/color are known from the catalog row).
- Per-row **✏️ Write** — downloads (if not already cached) and queues a tag-write (20 s window).

#### Fetch by UID
Enter a known UID directly and click **⬇ Fetch** to retrieve `data.bin` from `https://bambuman.ee/api/tags/{UID}/data.bin`.  Both the web API and the OLED follow the same 3-tier path resolution:

1. **Caller-supplied m/t/c** — if material, type, and color are passed explicitly (Search row results), used directly.
2. **Catalog lookup** — if any field is missing, `/BM/catalog.json` is stream-searched for the UID to fill in the gaps.  If the catalog has an entry the file lands in `/{MAT}/{TYPE}/{COLOR}/{UID}.bin`.
3. **Flat fallback** — `/BM/{UID}.bin` only if the catalog has no entry for this UID (e.g. catalog never synced).

### Tab 4 — Status
- Shows current WiFi mode, SSID, and IP address.
- Shows free heap and FAT usage (total / used bytes).
- Shows all data from the last read tag.

### Tab 5 — OTA Update
Check for and apply firmware updates without connecting a USB cable.

| UI element | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **Current firmware** | Displays the running `FIRMWARE_VERSION` |
| **🔍 Check for Updates** | Queries `GET /api/ota/check` → shows current and latest version |
| **⬆️ Flash Update** *(appears only when an update is available)* | `POST /api/ota/update` — streams the app binary, flashes, reboots |

- The **Check** step is read-only and safe to run at any time.
- The **Flash** step asks for confirmation before downloading.
- If the device reboots mid-response (successful flash), the JS detects the dropped connection and shows "Device rebooting… reconnect in a few seconds."
- **OLED mirrors the update progress in real time** — the same display used by the OLED-native OTA flow:

| Phase | OLED | LED |
|-------|------|-----|
| Fetching release info | `OTA Firmware` / `Web: checking...` + 0 % bar | — |
| Downloading & flashing | `OTA Firmware` / `Web: vX.Y.Z` + live progress bar | 🟡 amber |
| Success | `OTA Firmware` / `Done! Rebooting` + 100 % bar | 🟢 3 × flash |
| Check failed | `OTA Web` / `Check failed!` / hint | — |
| Flash error | `OTA Failed!` / error text | 🔴 3 × flash |

### Tab 6 — Config
- Shows current WiFi mode, SSID, and IP address.
- Scan for networks and connect to a new SSID + password.
- Credentials are saved to ESP32 NVS (via `Preferences`, namespace `wifi`) and restored on every boot — no file is written to FAT.
- **GitHub API Token** — enter a personal access token (read-only, no scopes required) and click **🔑 Save Token**.  The token is stored in NVS and injected as a `Bearer` header into every GitHub API request.  Leave blank to use unauthenticated access (60 req/hr limit).

## WiFi / Networking

1. On boot the sketch loads saved credentials from ESP32 NVS (`Preferences`, namespace `wifi`) and attempts to connect to the saved SSID.
2. If connection succeeds within 10 s, the OLED shows the IP and the LED turns dim cyan.
3. If it fails, the AP `BambuTagger` (password `bambu1234`) is started at `192.168.4.1` and the LED turns dim amber.
4. Use the **WiFi / Web** menu or the web UI to change credentials at any time.

---

## GitHub API Token

The OLED GitHub browser and the web Dumps tab both use the GitHub REST API to list repository contents.  Without authentication, GitHub enforces a limit of **60 requests per hour** per IP address.

To avoid hitting this limit:

1. Generate a free GitHub **Personal Access Token** (classic or fine-grained):  
   → [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)  
   No scopes are required — a token with zero permissions is sufficient for reading public repositories.
2. Open the BambuTagger web UI → **WiFi tab**.
3. Paste the token into the **GitHub API Token** field and click **🔑 Save Token**.
4. The token is saved to NVS and used automatically for all subsequent GitHub requests (rate limit raised to **5 000 req/hr**).

> The token is sent only to `api.github.com` and `raw.githubusercontent.com`.  It is never logged to serial output.

---

## FAT Directory Structure

Downloaded dump files are stored in a directory tree that mirrors the GitHub repository layout.  Parent directories are created automatically.

**Path mapping rules:**
- Each directory segment is **uppercased**
- Spaces are replaced with **underscores**
- The leaf filename is always `<UID>.bin` (extension forced to `.bin`)

| Source | FAT path |
|--------|----------|
| GitHub: `PLA/PLA Basic/Black/3AD82DAD/dump.bin` | `/PLA/PLA_BASIC/BLACK/3AD82DAD.bin` |
| GitHub: `ABS/ABS Basic/Red/F1A2B3C4/dump.json` | `/ABS/ABS_BASIC/RED/F1A2B3C4.bin` |
| BambuMan: material PLA, type PLA_BASIC, color Black, UID `9510C2A3` | `/PLA/PLA_BASIC/BLACK/9510C2A3.bin` |
| BambuMan: UID only (catalog has no entry for this UID) | `/BM/9510C2A3.bin` |
| BambuMan catalog index | `/BM/catalog.json` |
| BambuMan download index | `/BM/index.txt` |
| Manual web upload | `/<filename>.bin` (flat at root) |

---

## Dump File Format

Dump files are raw binary images of a MIFARE Classic 1K card:

- **Size:** exactly **1 024 bytes** (64 blocks × 16 bytes)
- **Layout:** block 0 at offset 0, block 63 at offset 1008
- **Extension:** `.bin`

The GitHub repository also contains `.json` dumps.  The firmware parses several common JSON layouts automatically and converts them to binary before saving.

---

## Key Derivation

Keys are derived per-sector per-card using **HKDF-SHA256**:

```
IKM  = tag UID (4 bytes)
Salt = 9a759cf2c4f7ca0e... (Bambu Lab salt, hardcoded)
Info = sector index (1 byte)
OKM  = first 6 bytes → MIFARE Key A
       next  6 bytes → MIFARE Key B
```

This mirrors the algorithm used by Bambu Lab's own firmware.  All derivation is done on-device using the ESP32's built-in mbedTLS library — no network call is needed.

---

## Serial Debug Output

Open the Serial Monitor at **115200 baud** to see timestamped logs:

```
========================================
  BambuTagger  – debug build
========================================
[STATE] -> READ_TAG
[RFID]  processReadTag: waiting for tag (15 s)...
[RFID]  UID: 3A D8 2D AD
[RFID]  Key derivation complete.
[AUTH]  blk=03 keyA A1B2C3D4E5F6 -> OK
[READ]  sector 00 auth -> OK
[READ]    blk 00: 3A D8 2D AD 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

To disable all debug output and save flash/RAM:

```cpp
// BambuTagger.ino, line 70
#define DEBUG_SERIAL 0
```

## Building & Flashing

### Manual build (Arduino IDE)

1. Install the Arduino IDE (≥ 2.x) and the [ESP32 board package](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).
2. Install all libraries listed above via **Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries**.
3. Open `BambuTagger.ino`.
4. Copy `partitions_4mb_custom.csv` into the ESP32 core's `tools/partitions/` directory (see [Custom partition table](#custom-partition-table) above).
5. Select **Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module** and set the partition scheme to **partitions_4mb_custom**.
6. Click **Upload**.
6. Open **Tools → Serial Monitor** at 115200 baud to watch the boot log.

> On first boot the FAT partition will be formatted automatically (`FFat.begin(true)`).

### Automated releases (GitHub Actions)

A workflow file at `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds and publishes releases automatically.

#### Trigger conditions

| Event | Compile | Release created |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Push / PR to `main` | ✅ (CI check) | ❌ |
| Push a `v*` tag (e.g. `v1.7.0`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Push a bare version tag (e.g. `1.7.0`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manual workflow dispatch | ✅ | only if tagged commit |

#### Creating a release

Before tagging, update `#define FIRMWARE_VERSION` near the top of `BambuTagger.ino` to match the tag (e.g. `"1.0.1"`).  The OTA check compares the running value against the release tag, so they must match.

```bash
# 1. Update FIRMWARE_VERSION in BambuTagger.ino, commit
git add BambuTagger/BambuTagger.ino
git commit -m "Bump to v1.0.1"

# 2. Tag and push — workflow compiles + publishes release automatically
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

The workflow compiles the sketch on **ESP32 Arduino core 2.0.17** using the custom partition table (`partitions_4mb_custom.csv`, app = 1408 KB, ffat = 1152 KB), merges all binary parts with `esptool.py merge_bin`, and attaches four files to the GitHub release:

| File | Flash address | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `BambuTagger_merged.bin` | `0x0` | **All-in-one** — flash this with `esptool write_flash 0x0 BambuTagger_merged.bin` |
| `BambuTagger.ino.bin` | `0x10000` | App binary only |
| `BambuTagger.ino.bootloader.bin` | `0x1000` | Bootloader |
| `BambuTagger.ino.partitions.bin` | `0x8000` | Partition table |

#### Flashing the merged binary (no Arduino IDE needed)

```bash
pip install esptool
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 write_flash 0x0 BambuTagger_merged.bin
```

On Windows replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the correct COM port (e.g. `COM3`).

> **Tip:** Arduino library installations and the ESP32 core are cached by the workflow — warm builds finish in ~45 seconds.
